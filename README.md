# Windows
A side project of mine that contains different C++ code snippets that forms a 'Proof of Concept' for certain Windows APIs. Try to see a bit like my own version of MSDN. It's just a side project of mine to explore more about how different Windows APIs are working, etc.

**NOTE:** I don't claim to be an expert.
